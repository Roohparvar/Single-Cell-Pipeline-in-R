# Single-Cell Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains a single-cell analysis pipeline using the dataset **GSE144469**.

## Data

The overall design of the dataset includes samples from 22 patients across 3 different cohorts:

- **Normal control**: 8 people
- **CPI no colitis**: 6 people
- **CPI colitis**: 8 people

However, for the purposes of this project, we selected 3 samples from each of the 3 cohorts, meaning the project was conducted on 9 total samples:

- **Normal control**: 3 people
- **CPI no colitis**: 3 people
- **CPI colitis**: 3 people

It is important to note that we focused on **CD3+ cells** in this study.\
The data is available in the `Data` folder.
