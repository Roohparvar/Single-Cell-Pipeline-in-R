# Single-Cell Analysis Pipeline
This repository contains a single-cell analysis pipeline using the dataset **GSE144469**.

## Data

The overall design of the dataset includes samples from 22 patients across 3 different cohorts:
- **Normal control**: 8 individuals  
- **CPI no colitis**: 6 individuals  
- **CPI colitis**: 8 individuals  

This study focuses specifically on **CD3+ cells**.  
The raw data can be found in the `Data` folder.

## First Step Analysis
As an initial and warm-up step, we performed a **basic analysis** on the raw data without dataset integration.  

This step includes:
- Standard Seurat preprocessing  
- UMAP visualization of the merged object  
- Identification of **marker genes** for each cluster

‚ö†Ô∏è All thresholds were chosen to support exploratory analysis and **can be modified** by users depending on their goals.

The related script is located in:  
`Without integration.R`  
Plots and outputs are saved in:  
`Merged_obj Data/`

Feel free to explore or extend this part of the analysis.

## Second Step Analysis
The next stage includes **integration of datasets** using Seurat's integration workflow.  
A new UMAP is generated to compare cluster behavior across the integrated datasets, enabling improved cross-sample analysis and interpretation.

## üß¨ Annotation Guide

**Annotation** is a critical phase that requires careful literature review and reading of relevant scientific articles. The guide below provides a helpful starting point, but **note**: this guide alone is not sufficient. A thorough literature review is essential to achieve high-quality annotations.

### üîç Identifying Major Cell Types

- If a cluster shows expression of **"CD4"** and **"CD40LG"** markers, it represents the **CD4 cell type**.
- If a cluster shows expression of **"CD8A"** and **"CD8B"** markers, it represents the **CD8 cell type**.

Both CD4 and CD8 T cells have several **subtypes**. Below, we first present **CD4 subclusters**, followed by **CD8 subclusters**.
